As of June 2012, PhiloLogic 4 has now entered alpha testing. It should compile and install reasonably well,
but should not be expected to be feature or documentation complete.
Note that this repository only contains the library code--see the related PhiloLogic4-Templates repo for a
"soup to nuts" web app framework.

Has a two step compile/install process, due to the layered C/Python architecture.

C Dependencies: 
gdbm - installed to your standard INCLUDE path [Mac users see :http://macosx.com/forums/unix-x11/257664-compile-gdbm.html]

Python Dependences:
2.6 and below: ElementTree 1.3alpha: http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree-13-intro.htm
2.7 and greater: None

Installation instructions:
make
sudo make install
cd python
python setup.py install

After installation, philologic will have installed:

low-level search executables to /bin/
PhiloLogic python library to your standard python path, according to distutils.

To get started loading documents, please install the PhiloLogic4-Templates package.
